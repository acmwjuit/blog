## How to prepare for GSoC

[Organisations selected for GSoC 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/) 
These are the organisations which were selected for gsoc 2019. Go through them and find few which you find interesting. Finalise and focus on 1 organisation, keep 1-2 organisations for safety in case your main target organisation isn't selected for GSoC next year.
In GSoC, students apply to an organisation and then the organisation gets slots (number of students they're allowed to select) from Google. As you can not know the number of students who applied to an organisation, just look at the number of students who got selected for an org before finalising it. If an organisation has 4 or more students selected and it is not a very small org then it'll probably get selected again next year in GSoC as well.
Once this is done, look at the projects of 2019 and 2020 GSoC students. Look at the softwares in which they worked. Once you find something you want to work on, contact the mentors of the organisation you selected and tell them that you want to contribute to this project. They'll tell you how to proceed next.
Usually you have a higher chance of being selected for GSoC if you've already contributed to the projects of the organisation you apply to.
"Regarding my approach, first I selected an organisation because there was a project in it on which I wanted to work. Then I learnt the technologies required to work on that project (it was a personal assistant written in ReactJS, so I learnt reactjs). Next I worked on some issues on this project on Github. When applications opened in feb 2018, I applied and got selected."
